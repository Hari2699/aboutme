Hi, I'm Hari! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled you stopped by. Let me tell you a bit about myself and what I do.

I'm a seasoned full-stack web developer with a passion for crafting digital solutions that make life easier and more enjoyable. My journey in the world of web development has been both exciting and rewarding, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges.

## What I Do
Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of web applications, utilizing popular tech stacks like MERN (MongoDB/MySQl, Express, React, Node) and PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node). 

I've contributed to the growth of startups and have also honed my skills in full-time roles, where I've had the chance to tackle diverse projects.
